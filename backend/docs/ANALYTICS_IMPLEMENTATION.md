## Quality Classification System

### Lead Quality Tiers
- **Hot Lead**: Score ≥ 80 (High-priority, immediate contact)
- **Warm Lead**: Score 60-79 (Follow up within 24 hours)
- **Qualified Lead**: Score 40-59 (Nurture with educational content)
- **Cold Lead**: Score 20-39 (Long-term nurture campaign)
- **Unqualified**: Score < 20 (Focus on value proposition)

### Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Total Score ≥ 70 AND Urgency Score ≥ 70
- **Medium Priority**: Total Score ≥ 50 AND Urgency Score ≥ 50
- **Low Priority**: All other combinations

## Recommendation Engine

The system generates contextual recommendations based on:
- **Score-based recommendations**: Actions based on total lead score
- **Urgency-based recommendations**: Timeline-sensitive actions
- **Budget-based recommendations**: Financial capacity considerations
- **CTA-based recommendations**: Actions based on interaction patterns

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Missing required fields in analytics data
- Invalid score ranges (outside 0-100)
- Malformed reasoning or CTA interaction structures

### Database Errors
- Connection failures with retry logic
- Query optimization for large datasets
