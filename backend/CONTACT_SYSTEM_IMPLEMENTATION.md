- **Contact Service**: Complete business logic with:
  - User-scoped contact retrieval with pagination and sorting
  - Contact creation with duplicate phone number validation
  - Contact updates with conflict detection
  - Contact deletion with ownership verification
  - Phone number normalization and validation
  - Contact statistics and analytics
- **Contact Controller**: Full REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/contacts` - List contacts with filtering and pagination
  - `POST /api/contacts` - Create new contact
  - `GET /api/contacts/:id` - Get single contact
  - `PUT /api/contacts/:id` - Update contact
  - `DELETE /api/contacts/:id` - Delete contact
  - `GET /api/contacts/stats` - Get contact statistics
- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests with 19 test cases covering all scenarios

### 2. Excel Bulk Upload (Task 6.2) ✅
- **File Processing**: Excel (.xlsx, .xls) parsing with XLSX library
- **Validation**: 
  - 1000 contact limit per upload
  - Required field validation (name, phone)
  - Phone number format validation
  - Duplicate detection (within file and existing data)
- **Flexible Column Mapping**: Supports multiple column name variations:
  - Name: `name`, `full_name`, `contact_name`
  - Phone: `phone`, `phone_number`, `mobile`, `cell`
  - Email: `email`, `email_address`
  - Company: `company`, `organization`, `business`
  - Notes: `notes`, `comments`, `description`
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing with detailed error reporting
- **Template Generation**: Excel template download for users
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/contacts/upload` - Bulk upload contacts
  - `GET /api/contacts/template` - Download Excel template
- **Tests**: 9 comprehensive test cases covering all upload scenarios

### 3. Contact Lookup API for ElevenLabs (Task 6.3) ✅
- **Single Lookup**: `GET /api/contacts/lookup/:phone`
  - Phone number validation
  - Detailed logging for monitoring
  - Returns contact name, company, and metadata flags
- **Batch Lookup**: `POST /api/contacts/lookup/batch`
  - Process up to 100 phone numbers at once
  - Individual error handling within batch
  - Summary statistics in response
- **Security Features**:
  - Optional API key authentication
  - Rate limiting for external requests
  - Request logging and monitoring
  - Graceful error handling
- **API Key Authentication**: 
  - Supports multiple API key sources
  - Development and production key support
  - Detailed authentication logging
- **Tests**: 12 test cases covering all lookup scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Uses existing `contacts` table from migration
- Proper indexes for performance
- User isolation with `user_id` foreign key
- Unique constraint on `user_id + phone_number`

### Phone Number Handling
- Automatic normalization to international format
- US number handling (adds +1 prefix)
- International number support
- Validation for minimum 10 digits

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error responses

### Security
- User-scoped data access
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on upload endpoints

### Performance Optimizations
- Database query optimization
- Batch processing for uploads
- Efficient duplicate detection
- Proper indexing strategy
