# Task 10.3 Implementation Summary: Build Lead and Call Data APIs

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive lead and call data APIs with filtering, pagination, and search capabilities for frontend ChatData/CallData components and LeadProfileTab component.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Leads API (`/api/leads`)

#### Core Functionality
- **GET /api/leads** - List leads with comprehensive filtering and pagination
- **GET /api/leads/:id** - Get single lead details for LeadProfileTab
- **GET /api/leads/:id/timeline** - Get lead interaction timeline
- **GET /api/leads/:id/profile** - Get comprehensive lead profile data
- **GET /api/leads/analytics** - Get lead analytics and distribution data

#### Filtering Capabilities
- **Search**: Text search across name, email, phone, and use case
- **Lead Type**: Filter by Customer, Outbound, Inbound
- **Business Type**: Filter by SaaS, E-commerce, Healthcare, etc.
- **Lead Tag**: Filter by Hot, Warm, Cold (based on lead analytics scores)
- **Platform**: Filter by Phone, WhatsApp, Instagram, Website
- **Agent**: Filter by specific agent name
- **Date Range**: Filter by interaction date range
- **Engagement Level**: Filter by High, Medium, Low engagement
- **Intent Level**: Filter by High, Medium, Low intent

#### Pagination & Sorting
- **Limit**: Control number of results (max 100)
- **Offset**: Skip results for pagination
- **Sort By**: name, interactionDate, leadTag, engagementLevel, intentLevel
- **Sort Order**: asc/desc

#### Data Transformation
- Converts call data to lead format expected by frontend
- Calculates lead tags based on analytics scores:
  - Hot: score >= 80
  - Warm: score >= 60 && < 80
  - Cold: score < 60
- Formats duration as MM:SS
- Estimates message count based on call duration
- Provides timeline data for LeadProfileTab

### 2. Enhanced Calls API (`/api/calls`)

#### Core Functionality
- **GET /api/calls** - List calls with advanced filtering and pagination
- **GET /api/calls/search** - Search calls across multiple fields
- **GET /api/calls/:id** - Get specific call details
- **GET /api/calls/:id/transcript** - Get call transcript
- **GET /api/calls/:id/recording** - Get call recording URL

#### Advanced Filtering
- **Search**: Text search across contact name, phone, agent name
- **Status**: Filter by completed, failed, in_progress, cancelled
- **Agent**: Filter by agent ID or agent name
- **Contact**: Filter by contact name or phone number
- **Date Range**: Filter by call date range
- **Duration**: Filter by min/max call duration
- **Content**: Filter by has_transcript, has_analytics
- **Lead Scoring**: Filter by min/max score, lead status, lead tag
- **Lead Tag**: Filter by Hot/Warm/Cold based on analytics scores

#### Search Functionality
- **Multi-field search**: Searches across contact name, phone, agent name, transcript content
- **Minimum length**: Requires at least 2 characters
- **Pagination**: Supports limit/offset for search results
- **Relevance**: Returns matching calls with highlighted search context

#### Sorting & Pagination
- **Sort Fields**: created_at, duration_minutes, total_score, contact_name, phone_number
- **Sort Order**: ASC/DESC
- **Default Sort**: Newest calls first (created_at DESC)
- **Pagination**: Limit/offset with hasMore indicator

### 3. Lead Profile Data for LeadProfileTab

#### Comprehensive Profile Structure
```typescript
{
  // Basic Information
  id, name, phone, email, company, platform, leadType, businessType, leadTag,
  
  // Interaction Data
  interactions, useCase, engagementLevel, intentLevel, budgetConstraint, timelineUrgency,
  
  // Timeline
  timeline: [
    {
      id, type: 'call', interactionAgent, interactionDate, platform,
      status, useCase, duration, engagementLevel, intentLevel,
      recording: boolean, transcript: string, actions
    }
  ],
  
  // Analytics Profile
  profile: {
    totalScore, 
    scores: { intent, urgency, budget, fit, engagement },
    reasoning: { intent, urgency, budget, fit, engagement, cta_behavior },
    ctaInteractions: { pricing_clicked, demo_clicked, followup_clicked, ... }
  }
}
```

#### Timeline Support
- Creates timeline entries for call interactions
- Includes call metadata (duration, recording availability, transcript)
- Supports multiple interaction types (currently call, extensible for chat)
- Provides chronological interaction history

### 4. Data Structure Compatibility

#### Frontend Component Compatibility
- **ChatData Component**: Provides all required fields (messages, platform, leadType, etc.)
- **CallData Component**: Provides call-specific fields (duration, recording, status)
- **LeadProfileTab Component**: Provides comprehensive profile with timeline and analytics

#### Field Mapping
- Maps call data to lead data structure expected by frontend
- Handles missing fields gracefully with sensible defaults
- Maintains consistency with existing frontend data models

### 5. Error Handling & Validation

#### Input Validation
- Validates query parameters and filters
- Enforces pagination limits (max 100 per request)
- Validates search term minimum length
- Sanitizes sort fields and order

#### Error Responses
- Consistent error response format
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful handling of missing data

### 6. Performance Optimizations

#### Efficient Filtering
- Client-side filtering for better performance with current data volumes
- Optimized sorting algorithms
- Pagination to limit response sizes

#### Data Processing
- Minimal data transformation overhead
- Efficient lead tag calculation
- Cached analytics calculations where possible
