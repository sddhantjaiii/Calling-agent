# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on connecting the frontend settings page to the actual backend API instead of using mock data. The integration will include disabling token purchase options for chat agents and implementing a simplified authentication flow without 2FA requirements for settings access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings page to display real data from the backend, so that I can see and modify my actual account settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the settings page THEN the system SHALL fetch user settings from the backend API
2. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the system SHALL display actual user data instead of mock data
3. WHEN a user modifies settings THEN the system SHALL save changes to the backend database
4. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the token purchase option for chat agents to be disabled, so that I cannot accidentally purchase tokens for this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the settings page THEN the system SHALL comment out or hide token purchase options for chat agents
2. WHEN a user attempts to access chat agent token purchase THEN the system SHALL prevent the action
3. WHEN displaying billing information THEN the system SHALL exclude chat agent token options
4. WHEN showing available features THEN the system SHALL not include chat agent token purchasing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access settings without complex authentication requirements, so that I can quickly update my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL not require 2FA verification by commenting out 2FA components
2. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow direct access to settings
3. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use simplified token-based authentication
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login without additional security steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the settings API integration to be robust and maintainable, so that future updates are easy to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API calls THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
2. WHEN making backend requests THEN the system SHALL include proper loading states
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate data before displaying
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful feedback to users
5. WHEN settings are updated THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize UI changes to the settings page, so that the integration is focused and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modifying the settings page THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing UI layout and design
2. WHEN disabling features THEN the system SHALL comment out relevant components rather than removing them
3. WHEN integrating backend APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain existing component structure
4. WHEN hiding 2FA and chat agent features THEN the system SHALL use code comments to disable functionality
