# API Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the performance of slow API endpoints in the AI Calling Agent SaaS platform. Through comprehensive analysis, we have identified that three critical APIs are experiencing 10+ second response times while similar billing APIs respond in under 1 second. The performance issues stem from complex database queries, external API calls, and inefficient data aggregation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dashboard Overview API Performance

**User Story:** As a user accessing the dashboard, I want the overview data to load in under 2 seconds, so that I can quickly see my KPIs and recent activity without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests `/api/dashboard/overview` THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds maximum
2. WHEN the dashboard cache is available and not expired THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of recalculating metrics
3. WHEN cached data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use optimized aggregation queries from `agent_analytics` table instead of individual call queries
4. WHEN calculating KPIs THEN the system SHALL avoid N+1 query patterns by using batch queries with proper JOINs
5. WHEN fetching recent activity THEN the system SHALL limit results to 5 items with proper indexing on `created_at` columns
6. WHEN multiple users access the dashboard simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-2-second response times under load

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Analytics API Performance

**User Story:** As a user viewing dashboard charts, I want the analytics data to load quickly, so that I can analyze trends and performance metrics without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests `/api/dashboard/analytics` THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds maximum
2. WHEN calculating leads over time THEN the system SHALL use indexed date queries with proper date range filtering
3. WHEN generating chart data THEN the system SHALL use pre-aggregated data from analytics tables instead of raw call data
4. WHEN processing multiple chart datasets THEN the system SHALL execute queries in parallel where possible
5. WHEN no data exists for time periods THEN the system SHALL generate empty data points efficiently without database queries
6. WHEN calculating lead quality distribution THEN the system SHALL use optimized CASE statements with proper indexing on score columns

### Requirement 3: Agents List API Performance

**User Story:** As a user managing my agents, I want the agents list to load instantly, so that I can quickly view and manage my AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests `/api/agents` THEN the system SHALL respond within 1 second maximum
2. WHEN fetching agent performance data THEN the system SHALL use batch queries instead of individual queries per agent
3. WHEN calling ElevenLabs API for agent configurations THEN the system SHALL implement parallel requests with proper error handling
4. WHEN ElevenLabs API is slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL return basic agent data without blocking the response
5. WHEN calculating agent statistics THEN the system SHALL use pre-aggregated data from `agent_analytics` table
6. WHEN transforming data for frontend THEN the system SHALL minimize database queries by fetching all required data in single queries

### Requirement 4: Database Query Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database queries to be optimized, so that the application can handle increased load efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing dashboard queries THEN the system SHALL use composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
2. WHEN aggregating analytics data THEN the system SHALL use materialized views or cached aggregations instead of real-time calculations
3. WHEN joining multiple tables THEN the system SHALL ensure proper foreign key indexes exist for all JOIN conditions
4. WHEN filtering by date ranges THEN the system SHALL use partitioned indexes or date-specific indexes for optimal performance
5. WHEN executing COUNT queries THEN the system SHALL use approximate counts or cached counts where exact precision is not required
6. WHEN performing complex aggregations THEN the system SHALL implement query result caching with appropriate TTL values

### Requirement 5: External API Call Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle ElevenLabs API calls reliably, so that temporary API issues don't prevent me from managing my agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling ElevenLabs API THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with maximum 3 attempts
2. WHEN ElevenLabs API calls fail after retries THEN the system SHALL continue with basic agent data without blocking the response
3. WHEN fetching multiple agent configurations THEN the system SHALL use concurrent requests to minimize total wait time
4. WHEN ElevenLabs API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL accept the delay as normal operation
5. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
6. WHEN all retries fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and return agent data without ElevenLabs configuration

### Requirement 6: In-Memory Caching Strategy

**User Story:** As a system user, I want frequently accessed data to be cached in memory, so that repeated requests are served instantly without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard data is requested THEN the system SHALL check in-memory cache first before executing database queries
2. WHEN agent analytics change THEN the system SHALL invalidate related in-memory cache entries automatically
3. WHEN cache entries expire THEN the system SHALL refresh them on next request without blocking the response
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL use LRU eviction policies to maintain optimal performance
5. WHEN cached data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL refresh it in the background after serving cached response
6. WHEN cache is empty THEN the system SHALL execute database queries and populate cache for future requests

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor API performance continuously, so that I can identify and resolve performance issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log response times for all endpoints
2. WHEN response times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger performance alerts
3. WHEN database queries are slow THEN the system SHALL log query execution times and plans
4. WHEN external API calls are slow THEN the system SHALL track and report third-party service performance
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for troubleshooting
6. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain performance monitoring accuracy

### Requirement 8: Load Testing and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the optimized APIs to handle concurrent users efficiently, so that the system remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 50 concurrent users access dashboard APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-2-second response times
2. WHEN database connections are under load THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling to prevent connection exhaustion
3. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement proper garbage collection and memory management
4. WHEN CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL maintain API responsiveness through proper resource allocation
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support multiple application instances with shared caching
6. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate consistent performance improvements over baseline measurements
