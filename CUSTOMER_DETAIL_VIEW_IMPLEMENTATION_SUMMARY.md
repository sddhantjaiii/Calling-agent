# Customer Detail View Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a customer detail view system that allows users to click on any customer in the customer management section to see detailed call logs and interaction history, similar to the lead intelligence functionality.

## Backend Changes

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/customers/:id` - Retrieves individual customer details with interaction timeline
- ✅ Fixed database query to properly reference `c.phone_number` instead of `ca.phone_number`

### Data Structure
The customer detail endpoint returns:
```json

    "customer": {
      "id": "uuid",
