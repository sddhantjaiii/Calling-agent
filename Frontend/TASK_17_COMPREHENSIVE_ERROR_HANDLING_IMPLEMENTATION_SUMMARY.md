- **Security:** Sanitizes sensitive data before reporting

**Error Report Contents:**
- Error details (message, stack trace, component stack)
- User context (ID, role, session info)
- System context (URL, browser info, performance metrics)
- Admin context (current section, permissions)
- Timestamp and unique error ID

### 6. Form Validation System
**File:** `Frontend/src/components/admin/ErrorHandling/AdminFormValidation.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Required, length, pattern, and custom validation rules
- **Real-time Feedback:** Validates on blur and change events
- **Error Aggregation:** Collects and displays all validation errors
- **Form State Management:** Tracks values, errors, touched fields, and submission state
- **Accessibility:** Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels

**Validation Features:**
- Field-level and form-level validation
- Custom validation functions
- Async form submission with validation
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Success and info message components
