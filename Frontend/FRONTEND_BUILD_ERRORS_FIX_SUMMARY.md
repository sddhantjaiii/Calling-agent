# Frontend Build Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. LoadingSpinner Export Issue
**Problem**: `LoadingSpinner` component was exported as default but imported as a named export in `AgentList.tsx`
**Solution**: Added named export alongside default export in `LoadingSpinner.tsx`
```typescript
export default LoadingSpinner;
export { LoadingSpinner };
```

### 2. EmptyState Export Issue  
**Problem**: `EmptyState` component was not exported from `EmptyStateComponents.tsx`
**Solution**: Added `EmptyState` as an alias to `BaseEmptyState` export
```typescript
export { BaseEmptyState };
export { BaseEmptyState as EmptyState };
export default BaseEmptyState;
```

## Build Status
✅ **Build now successful** - All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ **All imports/exports properly aligned**
✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**

## Files Modified
1. `Frontend/src/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Added named export
2. `Frontend/src/components/ui/EmptyStateComponents.tsx` - Added EmptyState alias export

## Build Output
- Successfully compiled 3886 modules
- Generated optimized production build
- All chunks built successfully with appropriate size warnings for large bundles

## Notes
- The build warnings about chunk sizes (>500kB) are informational and don't prevent successful compilation
- Consider code splitting for large chunks in future optimization work
- All existing functionality preserved while fixing import/export mismatches
