## Verification Commands

To verify the implementation:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Run the deployment script (staging)
node deploy-admin-panel.js staging

# Run security audit (in browser console)
import { adminSecurityAuditor } from './src/security/AdminSecurityAudit';
adminSecurityAuditor.performSecurityAudit();
```

The admin panel frontend is now fully integrated and ready for production deployment! ðŸš€
