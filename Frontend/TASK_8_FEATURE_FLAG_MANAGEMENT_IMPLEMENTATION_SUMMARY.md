- **Test Files**:
  - `FeatureFlagManager.test.tsx`: Comprehensive unit tests
  - `FeatureFlagManager.integration.test.tsx`: Integration tests
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Component rendering and state management
  - Feature flag toggle functionality
  - Bulk operations modal behavior
  - Tab navigation and content display
  - API integration and error handling
  - Export functionality
  - Tier management features

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 16.1: Feature Flag Management
✅ Implemented toggles for dashboard KPIs, agent analytics, and proprietary features

### Requirement 16.2: Default Disabled Features
✅ All proprietary features disabled by default for new users

### Requirement 16.3: User-Level Activation
✅ Individual user and user tier activation capabilities

### Requirement 16.4: Bulk Operations
✅ Bulk enable/disable features for multiple users with advanced targeting

### Requirement 16.5: Usage Monitoring
✅ Feature access tracking and usage analytics

### Requirement 16.6: Automatic Tier Management
✅ Automatic feature management based on subscription tier changes

### Requirement 16.7: Access Auditing

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
FeatureFlagManager/
├── Main Component (Tabbed Interface)
├── FeatureAnalytics (Usage Statistics)
├── TierFeatureManagement (Tier Controls)
├── BulkFeatureModal (Bulk Operations)
└── Enhanced Form Controls
```

### Data Flow
1. **Feature Flag Retrieval**: API service fetches current feature flag configurations
2. **Usage Analytics**: Mock data provides usage statistics (ready for real API integration)
3. **State Management**: React Query handles caching and real-time updates
4. **User Actions**: Toggle, bulk operations, and configuration changes
5. **API Updates**: Changes propagated to backend via admin API service

### Integration Points
- **Admin API Service**: Feature flag CRUD operations
- **Admin Context**: Role-based access control
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for operations
- **Query Client**: Real-time data synchronization

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time WebSocket Updates**: Live feature flag status updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed usage metrics and reporting
3. **A/B Testing Integration**: Feature flag-based testing capabilities
4. **Scheduled Feature Rollouts**: Time-based feature activation
5. **Feature Flag Templates**: Pre-configured feature sets for common scenarios

## Deployment Notes
- Component is fully integrated with existing admin panel structure
- Requires backend API endpoints for full functionality
- Mock data provides immediate functionality for testing and development
- Export functionality works client-side for configuration backup

## Security Considerations
- All feature flag operations require admin role authentication
- Sensitive feature access is logged and auditable
- Bulk operations include confirmation dialogs
- API key management includes secure display with masking

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for managing proprietary features, ensuring proper access control, usage tracking, and administrative oversight of premium platform capabilities.
