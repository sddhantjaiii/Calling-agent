### 7. Live User Activity Monitor (`LiveUserActivity.tsx`)
- **Real-time user activity feed** with filtering capabilities
- **Activity categorization** (authentication, agents, billing, contacts)
- **Auto-scroll functionality** for continuous monitoring
- **Activity filtering** by type and user
- **Visual activity indicators** with emoji and color coding

## Integration Features

### 1. Enhanced Admin Dashboard
- **Tabbed interface** with dedicated real-time section
- **Live metrics integration** in overview cards
- **Real-time connection status** in header
- **Notification indicators** with unread counts
- **Seamless switching** between static and live data

### 2. Enhanced Admin Header
- **Real-time connection indicator** with status colors
- **Notification bell** with unread count badge
- **Critical notification highlighting** for urgent alerts
- **Direct access** to notification center
- **Visual connection state feedback**

## Technical Features

### WebSocket Communication
- **Secure WebSocket connections** with token authentication
- **Message type handling** for different data types
- **Error handling and recovery** mechanisms
- **Connection pooling** and resource management
- **Cross-browser compatibility** with fallback support

### Real-Time Data Management
- **Efficient state updates** with React hooks
- **Memory management** with data limits (100 notifications, 50 activities)
- **Automatic cleanup** of old data
- **Optimistic updates** for better user experience
- **Data persistence** across component re-renders

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced updates** to prevent excessive re-renders
- **Selective subscriptions** to reduce bandwidth usage
- **Lazy loading** of real-time components
- **Efficient event handling** with proper cleanup
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper unsubscription

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Component Tests
- **RealTimeMetrics.test.tsx**: Tests for metrics display and updates
- **AdminNotificationCenter.test.tsx**: Notification management testing
- **useAdminWebSocket.test.tsx**: Hook functionality and state management
- **websocketService.test.ts**: WebSocket service behavior and error handling
- **RealTime.integration.test.tsx**: End-to-end integration testing

### 2. Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** for all components and hooks
- **Integration tests** for WebSocket communication
- **Error handling tests** for connection failures
- **State management tests** for data consistency
- **User interaction tests** for UI functionality

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- **Token-based WebSocket authentication** for secure connections
- **Role-based access control** (admin/super_admin only)
- **Automatic disconnection** on authentication failure
- **Session validation** with token refresh support

### 2. Data Security
- **Sensitive data masking** in notifications
- **Audit trail integration** for all admin actions
- **IP-based connection logging** for security monitoring
- **Rate limiting** for WebSocket connections
