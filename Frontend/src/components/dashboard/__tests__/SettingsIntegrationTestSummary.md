#### Requirement 1.2: Save changes to backend database  
- ✅ Test: `should save profile changes to backend when form is submitted`
- ✅ Test: `should save all extended profile fields correctly`
- **Coverage**: Verifies that form submissions correctly call the backend API with all profile data including extended fields.

#### Requirement 1.3: Form validation with real backend responses
- ✅ Test: `should handle backend validation errors for invalid email`
- ✅ Test: `should handle backend validation errors for invalid website URL`
- **Coverage**: Tests that the form properly handles validation errors returned from the backend API.

#### Requirement 4.4: Meaningful error feedback
- ✅ Test: `should handle network errors gracefully`
- ✅ Test: `should handle authentication errors`
- **Coverage**: Verifies that different types of errors (network, authentication, server) are handled with appropriate user feedback.

#### Requirement 4.5: Confirmation of successful changes
- ✅ Test: `should provide confirmation when settings are updated successfully`
- **Coverage**: Ensures users receive confirmation when settings are successfully updated.

### Additional Integration Tests

#### Data Persistence
- ✅ Test: `should verify data persists across form interactions`
- **Coverage**: Verifies that data changes are properly persisted and reflected in subsequent interactions.

#### Loading States
- ✅ Test: `should handle loading state during initial data fetch`
- **Coverage**: Tests that loading states are properly managed during API calls.

#### Error Handling Edge Cases
- ✅ Test: `should handle API failure during initial load`
- ✅ Test: `should handle empty update request`
- **Coverage**: Tests various edge cases and error scenarios.

## Conclusion

The integration testing implementation for Task 9 provides comprehensive coverage of the complete settings integration flow. All specified requirements are addressed through multiple test approaches:

1. **Unit-level integration tests** for individual components
2. **API integration tests** for backend functionality  
3. **End-to-end workflow tests** for complete user scenarios
4. **Error handling tests** for robustness
5. **Performance and reliability tests** for production readiness

The test suite ensures that the settings page properly integrates with the backend API, handles all extended profile fields correctly, provides appropriate user feedback, and maintains data integrity throughout the user interaction flow.
